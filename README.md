# Explore-Weather-Trend

This project explores local and global temperature datasets and compares their trends. Local temperature data were selected from Atlanta, which is the closest big city to where I live. 7-year moving averages (MA) were calculated and visualized with a line chart.
Steps taken to prepare and visualize the data were: SQL was used to prepare the data. Data were then exported to CSV where I calculated MAs and then visualized the data. Note that a common time frame of 1750 to 2013 was selected where we had data available from both datasets.
A 7-year MA was used.

# Observations:
1. The average temperature of Atlanta is higher compared to the globe’s average temperature. The difference has been relatively constant throughout the time series.
2. Although the magnitude and timing of variations (decreasing or increasing temperatures) are not the same, the overall changes are roughly similar between time series of local and global temperatures.
3. No clear increasing or decreasing trend is seen until 910 to 1920 on both local and global time series. From that time, increasing trends are observed on and confirms the fact that Atlanta and the globe (on average) are getting hotter.
4. The overall trend from 1920 is increasing on both local and global data. However, there is a period, around 1960 to 1980, when we see a decrease in Atlanta’s temperature and relatively constant temperature from the global data.
In summary, both local and global temperature datasets represent a warming temperature over the last decade.
